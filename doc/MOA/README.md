# MOA
This is a mirror of the Doxygen documentation for MOA as downloaded from http://code.google.com/p/moa/source/checkout.

The documentation has been generated by cloning those repositories as-is

```bash 
yum install mercurial.x86_64
hg clone https://code.google.com/p/moa/ 
```

installing prerequisites

``` 
yum install doxygen.x86_64
yum install graphviz.x86_64
```

and with an directory structure like:

```
# ls
doxygen  moa  pom.xml  weka-package
# ls doxygen/
build_docs.sh doxy.conf  html  latex
```

and then executing

```bash 
# bash doxygen/build_docs.sh
```
